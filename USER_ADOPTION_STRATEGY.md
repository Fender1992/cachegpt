  - Upload at: Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Social preview

- **Star your own repository** and ask early users to star
  - GitHub ranks repos by stars - aim for 100+ stars

#### C. Product Hunt Launch (Week 1) ‚≠ê CRITICAL
**Product Hunt can drive 1,000-10,000 users in one day**

**Preparation:**
1. Create compelling Product Hunt post:
   - **Title**: "CacheGPT - Free AI Chat with Zero Setup"
   - **Tagline**: "Chat with GPT-4, Claude & Gemini for free. No API keys needed. Just login and start chatting."
   - **Thumbnail**: Create eye-catching demo GIF showing:
     - `npm install -g cachegpt-cli`
     - `cachegpt chat` ‚Üí browser opens ‚Üí instant chat

2. **Hunter Strategy**:
   - Find a "hunter" with 1,000+ followers (increases visibility)
   - Post on Tuesday-Thursday 12:01 AM PST (highest traffic)

3. **Launch Day Actions**:
   - Reply to EVERY comment within 2 hours
   - Share on Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit simultaneously
   - Ask friends to upvote (but don't be spammy)

**Expected Result**: 500-2,000 signups on launch day

#### D. Reddit Marketing (Week 1-2)
**Post in these subreddits** (check rules first):

**High-Traffic Subreddits:**
- r/OpenAI - "I built a free ChatGPT CLI with caching"
- r/ClaudeAI - "Free Claude access via terminal"
- r/LocalLLaMA - "Caching layer reduces API costs by 80%"
- r/ChatGPT - "Zero-setup ChatGPT in your terminal"
- r/SideProject - "Built a free AI chat CLI in Next.js"
- r/InternetIsBeautiful - "Free AI chat, no API keys needed"
- r/commandline - "CacheGPT: AI chat in your terminal"
- r/programming - "Built semantic caching for LLM APIs"
- r/webdev - "How I reduced OpenAI costs by 80%"

**Posting Strategy:**
- Don't just promote - tell a **story**:
  - "I was spending $500/month on OpenAI. Built this caching layer. Now spending $100."
  - Include technical details (developers love this)
  - Add comparison chart (with/without caching)
  - Offer to answer questions in comments

**Expected Result**: 200-1,000 signups per successful post

### 2. SEO & Content Marketing

#### A. Blog Posts (Week 1-2)
Create `/app/blog` section with these articles:

1. **"How to Reduce OpenAI API Costs by 80%"**
   - Technical deep-dive on semantic caching
   - Include code examples
   - Compare cost: $500/month ‚Üí $100/month
   - SEO keywords: "reduce openai costs", "llm api caching"

2. **"Free ChatGPT Alternatives in 2025"**
   - List CacheGPT as #1 option
   - Compare: ChatGPT Plus vs CacheGPT vs API access
   - SEO keywords: "free chatgpt", "chatgpt alternative"

3. **"Semantic Caching for LLMs: Complete Guide"**
   - Explain pgvector + embeddings
   - Show performance benchmarks
   - SEO keywords: "semantic cache", "llm caching"

#### B. Documentation Site
Create comprehensive docs at `/docs`:

- Use Cases & Examples
- Troubleshooting

**Why**: Good docs = higher conversion rate (users less likely to bounce)

### 3. Social Proof & Trust Signals

#### A. Add to Homepage (Today)
```tsx
// Add this section to /app/page.tsx
<section className="py-12">
  <div className="max-w-5xl mx-auto text-center">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

#### B. Add Testimonials Section

- "What problem did CacheGPT solve for you?"
- "How much money/time did you save?"

Add 3-5 testimonials with:
- User name + photo (or initial avatar)

- Quote about cost savings or speed

### 4. Viral Growth Features

const referralCode = `${user.email.split('@')[0]}-${randomString(6)}`

// Give both referrer and referee a bonus:
- Referrer: +1000 free API calls
- Referee: +500 free API calls on signup
```

**Add to settings page:**
- "Invite friends, get 1000 free calls per friend"
- Share buttons for Twitter, LinkedIn, Email

#### B. Twitter/X Share Integration
Add "Share Result" button in chat interface:
```tsx
