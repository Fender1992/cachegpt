## üóëÔ∏è UNUSED COMPONENTS (Safe to Delete)

### 1. `/components/model-selector.tsx`

#### 2. `/app/changelog/page.tsx`
- **Links:** 0 references
- **STATUS:** "Placeholder Pages Created" - Product updates and release notes
- **Recommendation:** KEEP - Active placeholder linked from footer

#### 3. `/app/blog/page.tsx`
- **Links:** 1 reference (Footer)
- **STATUS:** "Blog placeholder (coming soon)"

- **Links:** 2 references
- **STATUS:** "Casual Settings Page" - 350+ lines, 4 tabs (Profile, Themes, Privacy, API Keys)
- **Recommendation:** KEEP - Fully implemented feature
- **Reason:** Alternative simpler settings for casual users vs enterprise settings

#### 5. `/app/casual-dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Links:** 2 references
- **STATUS:** "Casual Dashboard Page" - 320+ lines, separate from enterprise `/dashboard`
- **Recommendation:** KEEP - Fully implemented feature
- **Reason:** Shows stats cards, activity chart, badges for casual users

## üéØ CLEANUP RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (High Confidence)

```bash
# Delete truly unused components (confirmed safe)
rm /root/cachegpt/components/model-selector.tsx
rm /root/cachegpt/components/chat/ModelPreset.tsx
rm /root/cachegpt/components/ui/scroll-area.tsx

# CacheBadge: KEEP - Future integration planned (requires API changes)
# All pages: KEEP - Either implemented or intentional placeholders
```

### Review Required

**NONE** - All pages verified against STATUS file as either:
- Fully implemented features (casual-dashboard, casual-settings, status)
- Intentional placeholders with footer links (blog, changelog, docs)
- Active auth/admin flows (all kept)

### Bundle Size Impact

Removing the 3 confirmed unused components would save approximately:
- **Estimated:** ~5-8 KB minified (minimal impact)
- **Maintenance:** Reduced complexity, 3 fewer files to maintain
- **Files to remove:** model-selector.tsx, ModelPreset.tsx, scroll-area.tsx

## üìä FEATURE FLAG AUDIT

### Unused Feature Flags (OFF by default)

- `ux_cache_badges` - ‚úÖ Component exists (CacheBadge.tsx), awaiting API changes for integration
- `ux_gamified_toasts` - ‚úÖ Component exists (CacheToast.tsx), ready for integration
- `ux_voice_input` - ‚ùå No component found - flag can be removed
- `ux_file_upload` - ‚ùå No component found - flag can be removed

**Recommendation:**
- KEEP: `ux_cache_badges`, `ux_gamified_toasts` (components built, ready to enable)
- REMOVE: `ux_voice_input`, `ux_file_upload` (no implementation)

---

## üîç NEXT STEPS

1. ‚úÖ **Audit Complete** - Cross-referenced with STATUS_2025_09_24.md
2. **Delete 3 unused components** (optional, minimal impact):
   - `components/model-selector.tsx`
   - `components/chat/ModelPreset.tsx`
   - `components/ui/scroll-area.tsx`
3. **Remove 2 unused feature flags** from types and defaults:
   - `ux_voice_input`
   - `ux_file_upload`
4. **All pages are intentional** - No page deletions needed
5. **CacheBadge & CacheToast** - Ready for integration when API supports it

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNINGS

- **Dashboard components**: Currently marked as unused but are imported by `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`. This page appears to be for enterprise users. Verify before deleting.
- **Auth pages**: Keep all auth-related pages - they're used in various OAuth flows
- **Admin pages**: Keep all admin tools - used by administrators

---

## üíæ Bundle Size Optimization

After cleanup, consider:
1. Run `yarn build` and check bundle analyzer
2. Look for duplicate dependencies in `yarn.lock`
3. Check for large unused dependencies in `package.json`
4. Consider lazy loading heavy components
