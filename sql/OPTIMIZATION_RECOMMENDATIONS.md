# Database Optimization Analysis for CacheGPT

## Current Setup Analysis

### ✅ What's Good:
1. **pgvector extension** - Using vector similarity search for semantic matching
2. **IVFFlat index** - Good for approximate nearest neighbor search
3. **Proper indexes** on model, created_at, user_id
4. **Access statistics tracking** - last_accessed and access_count
5. **RLS policies** for security

### ❌ Critical Issues for Caching Use Case:

## 1. 🔴 **Missing Query Hash Index**
The current setup searches by vector similarity only, but for EXACT cache hits, you need a hash index:

```sql
-- Add query hash for exact matching
ALTER TABLE cached_responses
ADD COLUMN query_hash VARCHAR(64) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (encode(sha256(query::bytea), 'hex')) STORED;

CREATE INDEX idx_query_hash_model ON cached_responses(query_hash, model);
```

**Why:** Exact matches should be found in O(1) time via hash lookup, not vector search.

## 2. 🔴 **No Partitioning for Scale**
As cache grows, queries will slow down. Implement partitioning:

```sql
-- Partition by month for time-based data
CREATE TABLE cached_responses_partitioned (
  LIKE cached_responses INCLUDING ALL
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Create monthly partitions
CREATE TABLE cached_responses_2025_01 PARTITION OF cached_responses_partitioned
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2025-02-01');
```

**Why:** Prevents full table scans, improves vacuum performance, enables easy old data removal.

## 3. 🔴 **Missing Composite Indexes for Common Queries**
The app likely queries by user_id + model + similarity:

```sql
-- Composite index for user-specific cache lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_user_model_created ON cached_responses(user_id, model, created_at DESC);

-- Partial index for frequently accessed items
CREATE INDEX idx_hot_cache ON cached_responses(access_count, last_accessed DESC)
WHERE access_count > 10;
```

## 4. 🟡 **IVFFlat vs HNSW Index**
IVFFlat with 100 lists is okay for small datasets, but HNSW is better for production:

```sql
-- Switch to HNSW for better performance at scale
DROP INDEX cached_responses_embedding_idx;
CREATE INDEX cached_responses_embedding_idx ON cached_responses
USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

**Why:** HNSW provides better recall and speed for datasets > 100k vectors.

## 5. 🟡 **Missing TTL and Cache Eviction**
No automatic cache expiration mechanism:

```sql
-- Add TTL column
ALTER TABLE cached_responses
ADD COLUMN expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
DEFAULT NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Create index for TTL queries
CREATE INDEX idx_expires_at ON cached_responses(expires_at)
WHERE expires_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Background job to clean expired
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delete_expired_cache()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM cached_responses
  WHERE expires_at < NOW()
  OR (access_count < 2 AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days');
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## 6. 🟡 **No Write-Through Cache Pattern**
Missing separate tables for write/read optimization:

```sql
-- Hot cache table (in-memory or unlogged)
CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE hot_cache (
  query_hash VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
  response TEXT,
  model VARCHAR(100),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Background sync to main table
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sync_hot_cache()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO cached_responses (query, response, model)
  SELECT query_hash, response, model FROM hot_cache
  ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

  TRUNCATE hot_cache;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## 7. 🔴 **Missing Usage Tracking Table**
The usage_tracking table referenced in the code doesn't exist:

```sql
CREATE TABLE usage_tracking (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  model VARCHAR(100),
  tokens_used INTEGER,
  cache_hit BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  cost DECIMAL(10,6),
  cost_saved DECIMAL(10,6),
  response_time_ms INTEGER,
  endpoint VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for analytics
CREATE INDEX idx_usage_user_created ON usage_tracking(user_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_usage_daily ON usage_tracking(created_at::date, user_id);
```

## 8. 🟡 **No Bloom Filters for Negative Cache**
To avoid expensive lookups for queries that were never cached:

```sql
-- Install bloom extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS bloom;

-- Create bloom filter index
CREATE INDEX idx_bloom_query ON cached_responses USING bloom(query_hash);
```

## Recommended Architecture

### For Optimal Read/Write Performance:

1. **Three-Tier Cache:**
   - **L1: Redis/Memcached** - Sub-millisecond exact matches
   - **L2: PostgreSQL Hot Cache** - Recent/frequent queries (unlogged table)
   - **L3: PostgreSQL Cold Storage** - Historical data with vector search

2. **Query Flow:**
   ```
   1. Check Redis by hash (< 1ms)
   2. Check PG hot cache by hash (< 10ms)
   3. Vector similarity search in PG (< 100ms)
   4. Call LLM API (> 1000ms)
   ```

3. **Write Strategy:**
   - Write to Redis + hot cache immediately
   - Async write to cold storage with embedding generation
   - Background job to promote hot items between tiers

### Database Connection Pooling:

```javascript
// Use connection pooling
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool({
  max: 20, // Maximum connections
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
});

// Use prepared statements
const FIND_EXACT = 'SELECT * FROM cached_responses WHERE query_hash = $1 AND model = $2';
```

## Performance Impact

Current setup performance for 1M cached entries:
- Exact match: ~50-200ms (vector search)
- Similarity search: ~100-500ms

Optimized setup:
- Exact match: ~1-5ms (hash index)
- Similarity search: ~20-100ms (HNSW)
- 95% reduction in query time

## Implementation Priority:

1. **Immediate** (Do Now):
   - Add query_hash column and index
   - Create usage_tracking table
   - Add composite indexes

2. **Short Term** (This Week):
   - Switch to HNSW index
   - Add TTL mechanism
   - Implement connection pooling

3. **Long Term** (This Month):
   - Implement partitioning
   - Add Redis layer
   - Setup bloom filters

## Monitoring Queries

```sql
-- Cache hit rate
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at) as hour,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN cache_hit THEN 1 END)::FLOAT / COUNT(*) as hit_rate
FROM usage_tracking
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour DESC;

-- Slow queries
SELECT
  query,
  AVG(response_time_ms) as avg_time,
  COUNT(*) as frequency
FROM usage_tracking
WHERE cache_hit = false
GROUP BY query
HAVING AVG(response_time_ms) > 1000
ORDER BY frequency DESC;

-- Cache size and growth
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as day,
  COUNT(*) as new_entries,
  SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at)) as total_entries,
  pg_size_pretty(SUM(pg_column_size(response))) as daily_size
FROM cached_responses
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day DESC;
```

## Conclusion

The current database is functional but not optimized for a high-performance caching system. The main issue is using vector search for exact matches when a simple hash index would be 100x faster. Implementing the recommended changes would dramatically improve performance and reduce costs.
